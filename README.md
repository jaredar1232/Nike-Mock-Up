### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

To run the application:

1. clone down the repo

2. clone down the submodules by running "git submodule update --init --recursive" from the root directory

3. cd into each of the 3 services and run "npm install" from their roots. Ie, cd into "FEC-Service-Jared" and run "npm install", repeat for the other two services (Nick/Stacey)

4. cd back out to the proxy root "Nike-Mock-Up" and run "npm install"

5. run "npm start" (this is fully automated to seed all 3 databases and start all 4 servers)

NOTE: make sure to have mongoDB installed on the local machine.
